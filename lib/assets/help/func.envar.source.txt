Source env paths. If a path is a directory all
*.{bash,env,sh} files will be loaded, for file
paths extension doesn't matter

Usage:
  envar.source [OPTIONS...] [ENVS]

Available options:
  -D, --deskless (flag)
    Run in deskless mode, i.e new bash process
    won't be created
  -f, --pathfile (multiple)
    Read env paths list from a file. Empty
    lines and lines starting with '#' are
    ignored. Non-absolute paths are resolved
    relatively to $PWD. Paths prefixed with
    ':' are resolved relatively to pathfile
    directory. Example:
      # resolves to $PWD
      ./envdir/envfile1.sh
      # resolves to pathfile directory
      :/envdir/envfile2.sh
  --gen-pathfile (flag)
    Generate pathfile dummy to stdout
  -n, --name
    Name a desk environment
  --
    End of options
